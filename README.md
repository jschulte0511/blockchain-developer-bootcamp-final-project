Project for Consensys Academy

In South Afrcia a Stokvel is a type of credit union in which a group of people enter into an agreement to contribute a fixed amount of money to a common pool weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Universally, such a system is known as a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA), which is a group of individuals who agree to meet for a defined period in order to save together. 

For this project, I will provide a platform that allows the creation of a smart contract that regulates a stokvel used specifically for funeral expenses which is a common type of stokvel in South Africa that allows it's members to bury thier loved ones with dignity. During the creation of the stokvel smart contract the user will have the ability to 

1. Determine the minimum number of members
2. Monthly contribution
3. Number of members that have to confirm a payout on death of a member's relative
4. Value of payout relative to funds available

Further use cases will cover what happens if a member withdraws or does not make his monthly payment.
